# Blue Brain Atlas Pipeline
This pipeline is in charge of the orchestration of all the modules involved in the creation of the Atlas datasets at BBP, included but not limited to:
- Gene expression volumes (NRRD)
- Cell density volume (NRRD)
- Brain region annotation hybrid volume (NRRD)
- Orientation volume (NRRD)
- Brain region meshes (OBJ)
- Cell position and orientation file (HDF5)

This atlas relies on Allen Mouse CCF v2 and v3 dataset.
